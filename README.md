Walking simulator: spatial design and environmental storytelling project


# #AboutTheProject
This is a simple one-day project.

The project's primary focus is to create a spatial design and environmental storytelling mini-game.

The important keys are

## 1. Level Design
Draw a map of an environment for a walking simulator and create levels based on it.

## 2. Environmental storytelling
Pay attention to environmental storytelling, i.e., how your levels tell a story (see guidelines below).

## 3. Story
Use own story.

## 4. Walking Simulator Design
A “walking simulator” is a usually a narrative-driven, exploration-heavy game with few additional challenges or game mechanics.

## 5. Clues
In walking simulators, the player often navigates an environment to collect clues about the story of the game world.

## 6. Upload
